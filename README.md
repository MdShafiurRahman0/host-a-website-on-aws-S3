### Host a Website on AWS S3



üåê Hey everyone! üëã

I'm excited to share my latest project where I created and hosted a simple HTML page with an image on Amazon S3 as a static website. üéâ


#### Description:
This project involves creating a simple yet elegant HTML page designed to showcase a beautiful image. The HTML page was developed with a focus on minimalism, ensuring a clean and visually appealing layout. The page was then hosted using Amazon S3's static website hosting feature, which provides a robust and scalable solution for serving static content. To ensure the website is both secure and accessible, a bucket policy was configured to allow public read access while adhering to security best practices. This project demonstrates effective use of HTML and Amazon S3 for hosting static websites, along with implementing appropriate security measures.


### Project Highlights:

1. **HTML** : Designed a minimalistic HTML page to showcase a beautiful image.
2. **Amazon S3**: Leveraged Amazon S3's static website hosting feature to make the page publicly accessible.
3. **Bucket Policy**: Configured the S3 bucket policy to ensure the website is secure yet accessible to everyone.




### Step 1: Create Bucket in Amazon S3

1.Log in to your AWS Account.
2.In the AWS Management Console, search for S3.
3.Choose Create bucket.
